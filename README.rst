Semanticizer, standalone
========================

Semanticizest is a package for doing entity linking, also known as
semantic linking or semanticizing: you feed it text, and it outputs links
to pertinent Wikipedia concepts. You can use these links as a "semantic
representation" of the text for NLP or machine learning, or just to provide
some links to background info on the Wikipedia.

This is the Go version of semanticizest.


Installing
----------

Make sure you have a Go compiler (1.2 or newer) and Git.
On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, that's::

    sudo apt-get install git golang-go

On CentOS::

    sudo yum -y install git golang

Set up a Go workspace, if you haven't already. For example::

    mkdir /some/where/go
    cd /some/where/go
    export GOPATH=$(pwd)

Fetch and compile::

    go get -u github.com/semanticize/st/...

You now have a working parser at ``${GOPATH}/bin/semanticizest-dumpparser``.
Issue::

    ${GOPATH}/bin/semanticizest-dumpparser --help

to figure out how to generate a semanticizer model, then use this model from
the REST API::

    ${GOPATH}/bin/semanticizest --http=:5002 your_model
    curl http://localhost:5002/all -d 'Does the entity linking work?'

You can also use semanticizest as a command-line tool by omitting ``--http``.
In that case, it will read paragraphs (double newline-separated) from standard
input and emit a JSON representation of the candidate entities in each
paragraph.

Python binding
==============

Once you have built a semanticizer model, you can use semanticizest from Python
using the Python wrapper. You can use the python wrapper as follows.  Assuming you have a serverd running on port 5002 as described above::

    from semanticize import Semanticizer
    
    sentence = 'Antwerpen'
    serverURL = 'http://localhost:5002/'
    client = Semanticizer(serverURL)
    candidates = client.all_candidates(sentence)

A *SemanticizerServer* class also provides the option of starting the semanticizer
server from Python, removing dependency on an external server. However, this server
runs on a random port on localhost and thus may be limited by the hardware of the
local machine. You must have build a model first and provide a path for semanticizest.
You can start, use and stop the server as follows::

    from semanticize import SemanticizerServer, Semanticizer
    
    sentence = 'Antwerpen'
    server = SemanticizerServer(model='nlsample.go.model', serverpath='./bin/semanticizest')
    client = Semanticizer(server.url)
    candidates = client.all_candidates(sentence)
    server.terminate()
